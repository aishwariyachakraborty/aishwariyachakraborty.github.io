            <p class="blog-date">Published in January, 2026</p>
            <p>
                I started exploring PyTorch Compile since mid 2025, for some work related stuff. As I got to know more about it, I got more and more interested. The way
                it is designed in PyTorch is extremely complex, which fascinated me. So I learnt about how it works underneath, all the way down to Python Interpreter! 
                Parallely and inevitably, I started to get familiar with the field of Deep Learning (DL) Compilers. Although scared at first, I could not resist the 
                curiousity it arose in me. I learnt about the various compile backends that are supported by PyTorch, including the default inductor. Digging deeper into 
                the inductor and beyond, I learnt about MLIR, LLVM, and Triton. I also went breadth-wise from the torch.compile() and found out about various existing 
                compilers such as TVM, Glow, and XLA. At present, I have an idea of the lay of the land of DL compilers with depth only in torch.compile and inductor. 
                Hence, my plan is to go deeper into the topics I have found to be most interesting and document my knowledge in this series of blogs.

                If you are someone who is fascinated by this space as well, I invite you to tag along!
